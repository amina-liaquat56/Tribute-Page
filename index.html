    <h2>About A.P.J Abdul Kalam</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in a Muslim family in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, Kalam studied physics and aerospace engineering. He 
        spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in
        India's civilian space programme and military missile development efforts. He was known as the "Missile Man of
        India" for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, India's second such
        test after the first test in 1974.</p>
